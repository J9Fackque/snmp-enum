# snmp-enum
This is a simple bash enumeration script that takes an IP list as input and records output for common Windows and Dell MIB OIDs.

**Command to run:** sudo ./snmpscan.sh *communityString*
  
The IP list that gets imported must be just a list of IPs, one on each line.

**Example:**
```192.168.1.2
192.168.1.3
192.168.1.5
192.168.1.7
192.168.1.8
192.168.1.15
...```
